# Hi, I’m **Shahriyar Ahmed Mahir** 👋  
**Software • Industrial Engineering • Real-World ML Systems**


Hi, I am a second year Industrial Engineering + PEY Co-op student at UofT. I like to synthesize **scalable systems** and design solutions that blend **software engineering** with **industrial engineering** to improve real-world operations. I scout industry workflows, map constraints, and prototype **AI-assisted** processes that increase throughput, quality, and decision speed.

I’m passionate in **machine intelligence**, **consulting**, and **operations & management**. 

As my "productive" 😃 hobby, I create content on **productivity** at the intersection of **cognitive science** and **psychology**—sharing practical frameworks with strategies on emotional regulation, and meaningful execution.

## 🧠 What I Recently Built
- **Retrieval-aware applications** (RAG/semantic search/doc Q&A) that ground answers in sources and are instrumented for **latency, freshness, and quality**—built to be explainable and maintainable.
- **Pragmatic backends & APIs**: typed Python services (FastAPI), auth/storage integrations, and basic **observability**—shipped with docs, runbooks, and **acceptance criteria** so teams can reproduce results.
- **IE-informed systems**: map workflows and constraints, design simple **process controls** and feedback loops, and use OR/Stats thinking to turn messy operations into **predictable pipelines**.

## 🚀 My Recent Project
### OpsVista — Retrieval-Augmented Generation Platform
**Stack:** FastAPI · Next.js · Supabase (RBAC) · PostgreSQL · OpenAI API · Uvicorn  
**Highlights:** Dual-path retrieval (enhanced local index + fallback), semantic chunking (1536-dim), batch/API index refresh, trace observability; **answers in seconds** with **p95 chat ≤ 5s**, **p95 retrieval ≤ 500ms**, **≥ 80% citations**, **< 1-day onboarding** via runbooks.  
[Repo Link](https://github.com/mahirvisoredbroom855/opsvista-software)

### ChronoTrack — Minimal Time & Focus Tracker (CLI)
**Stack:** Python · Typer · Rich · SQLite/JSON  
**Overview:** A keyboard-first CLI to log work sessions (start/stop), tag by project/label, add quick notes, and generate daily/weekly summaries with exportable CSV/JSON. Optional Pomodoro-style focus timer.  
**Why:** Keep work observable and portable for retrospectives and capacity planning—without SaaS lock-in.
